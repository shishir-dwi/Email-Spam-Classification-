# Email-Spam-Classification
This project is designed to classify emails as either spam or not spam using machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify emails based on their content.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:
<ul>
  <li>Pandas<\li>
  <li>Numpy<\li>
  <li>Matplotlib<\li>
  <li>Seaborn<\li>
  <li>Sklearn<\li>
  <li>NLTK<\li>
<\ul>

Write these commands on `command prompt` to install the required libraries.
For Example:
<ul>
  <li>pip install pandas<\li>
  <li>pip install numpy<\li>
  <li>pip install matplotlib<\li>
